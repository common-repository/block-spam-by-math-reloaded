This plugin protects your Wordpress and Buddypress login, comments, and new user/new blog signup process against spambots with a simple math question.

== Description ==
This plugin protects your Wordpress 3.x login, comments, and new user/new blog signup process against spambots with a simple math question. This plugin adds an extra layer of protection against comment spam and spam blog creation bots. While nothing is 100% fool proof the concept has been proven many times in various forms in the past. Block Spam By Math Reloaded combines the features of WPMU Block Spam By Math and the original Block Spam By Math into one plugin that supports the Wordpress 3.x and Buddypress 1.2.7 platforms.

This plugin is based on the original <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/block-spam-by-math/">Block-Spam-By-Math</a> plugin created by <a href="http://www.grauonline.de">Alexander Grau</a>.
